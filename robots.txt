Here is **exactly** what the client is asking for, in **clear and simple words** 👇

## ✅ Client Feedback – Explained Clearly

The client is **happy with the site overall**, but wants **three specific changes**.

---

### 🔹 1️⃣ Header Background Color Change

**Current:**

* Header background is dark / transparent (or not white)

**Client Wants:**

* **Header background → WHITE**
* **Menu link color → `#4c1569` (purple)**

👉 This applies to:

* Desktop menu
* Mobile menu (recommended for consistency)

---

### 🔹 2️⃣ Homepage Hero Section Update

**Current homepage hero includes:**

* Parts Available
* Years Experience
* Customer Help

**Client Wants to REMOVE those**

---

### 🔹 3️⃣ Replace Hero Stats With Brand Logos / Names

**Client Wants:**

* Show **appliance brands** instead of stats
* Brands should be the **same ones used in Compatibility sections**
  (Whirlpool, LG, Samsung, GE, Bosch, etc.)

📍 Location:

* **Homepage hero section**
* Where stats currently exist

👉 Example:
Instead of:

* 10,000+ Parts

* Bosch
  (or logos if available)

## 🧠 Summary in One Line

> “Make the header white with purple links, and replace the homepage hero stats with appliance brand names/logos that match the compatibility sections.”

If you want, next I can:

Just say **next**.
